## DOCTYPES
### Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included). We will therefore be including one in each example for the rest of the book.
### As you will see when we come to look at CSS and its box model onpage 316, the use of a DOCTYPE can also help the browser to render a page correctly.
### Because XHTML was written in XML, you will sometimes see pages that use the XHTML strict DOCTYPE start with the optional XML declaration. Where this is used, it should be the first thing in a document. There must be nothing before it, not even a space.

## Comments in HTML
### < !-- --> (without space)
### If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser, you can add the text between these characters:
### < !-- comment goes here --> (without space)
